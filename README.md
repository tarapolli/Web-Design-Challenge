Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude
For this homework, I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations that I created in a past assignment. Specifically, I plotted weather data. In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. The dashboard contains the following pages:
•	landing page (index)
•	comparison page where you can flip to all of the plots
•	data page where we can view the data used to build them
For reference, we were given screen shots from a similar dashboard. See link below of my final dashboard:
